                is make a keepsake of this moment for us to look back on.
                I have saved newspapers, art work done by my kids, taken photos of all our days and kept a diary.
                BUT I have also been working on a "time capsule" work sheet for my daughter, son and I to fill out.
                This will be available as a FREE resource for any of my fans."

                <h3>Please Note</h3>
                <p>This time capsule design was created and is supplied for free by <a
                    href="https://longcreations.ca">LONG Creations</a>. Natalie Long has been a long time friend of
                  embark
                  and has helped us with several projects. We wanted to return the favor, so we offered to host her
                  files and create this page to help alleviate the traffic she was
                  receiving.</p>
                <p>Simply put: We created this page because the original Facebook post went viral and you guys
                  literally crashed the Dropbox and Google Drive with the sheer amount
                  of downloads. We will do our best to maintain the above links, but please bear with us as we try and
                  manage the number of downloads being requested.</p>

                <p>Please remember this is a free resource, and we are trying our best to make it available to everyone!

                    difficult time, it is meant as a GIFT not for profit!"</blockquote>
